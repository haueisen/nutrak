Nutrition Scanning App


Considerations:

- No custom fonts were included in the app, the design shows Roboto font family while the Typography is using Inter font family
- Implemented light and dark modes
- Colors in the style guide are showing the wrong HEX. E.g Text medium emp is #565656 but the label says #686B6B. The real value and not the label was used for the app colors
- Scanner is a class mocking the behavior of a business logic class which have no coupling with views
- I opted to make the buttons on the nutrition results screen stick to the bottom of the screen instead of scroll with the results content
- I slighty modified the layout of results screen since it is to add a chart to the results
- Scanning screen is placeholder
