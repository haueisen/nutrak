Nutrition Scanning App


Considerations:

- No custom fonts were included in the app, the design shows Roboto font family while the Typography is using Inter font family
- Only implemented light mode. Everything is in place for dark mode to work, just need to modify color assets.
- Colors in the style guide are showing the wrong HEX. E.g Text medium emp is #565656 but the label says #686B6B. The real value and not the label was used for the app colors
